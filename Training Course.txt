// Prerequisites:

cd ~/fabric-dev-servers
export FABRIC_VERSION=hlfv12
./startFabric.sh
./createPeerAdminCard.sh


// Step One: Creating a business network structure

yo hyperledger-composer:businessnetwork

Enter y for the network name, and desired information for description, author name, and author email.

Select Apache-2.0 as the license.

Select org.healthcare as the namespace.

Select No when asked whether to generate an empty network or not.



// Step Two: Defining a business network
.cto
permissions.acl
logic.js



//Step Three: Generate a business network archive
Using the command line, navigate to the healthcare-network directory.
From the healthcare-network directory, run the following command:
composer archive create -t dir -n .


// Step Four: Deploying the business network


Prepare the Hyperledger Fabric peers

composer network install \
--card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 \
--archiveFile healthcare-network.bna


Start your Business Network on your Hyperledger Fabric

composer network start \
--networkName healthcare-network \
--networkVersion 0.0.2-deploy.172 \
--networkAdmin admin \
--networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw \
--card PeerAdmin@hlfv1

To import the network administrator identity as a usable business network card, run the following command:
composer card import --file admin@healthcare-network.card

To check network deployed successfully
composer network ping --card admin@healthcare-network

// Step Five: Generating a REST server
To create the REST API, navigate to the healthcare-network directory and run the following command:
composer-rest-server

Enter admin@healthcare-network as the card name.

Select never use namespaces when asked whether to use namespaces in the generated API.

Select No when asked whether to secure the generated API.

Select Yes when asked whether to enable event publication.

Select No when asked whether to enable TLS security.


// Step Six: Generating an application

To create your Angular 4 application, navigate to healthcare-network directory and run the following command:
yo hyperledger-composer:angular





  composer identity issue -c admin@healthcare-network -f nh1.card -u nh1 -a "resource:org.healthcare.NursingHome#nh1"





Destroy a previous setup

    docker kill $(docker ps -q)
    docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
    docker rmi $(docker images dev-* -q)
